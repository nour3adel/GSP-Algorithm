# Data Mining project 2022/2023 [![run](run)]([https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dmeoli/DataMiningUniPi/master](https://github.com/nour3adel/GSP-Algorithm/blob/main/Main%20Project.ipynb))

This project was developed during the Data Mining course @ 
[Department of Computer Science](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3201028960212058) @ [University of Ain shams](https://www.asu.edu.eg/) 


The project consists in data analysis based on the use of data mining tools.
The project has to be performed by a team of 3/5 students. It has to be performed by
using Python.

##  GSP-Algorithm
Implementation of Apriori-based method: GSP (Generalized Sequential Patterns: Srikant &amp; Agrawal) 
Consider the problem of mining frequent sequential patterns. To address the task:
- Model the customer as a sequence of baskets
- Apply the sequential pattern mining algorithm
- Discuss the resulting patterns
